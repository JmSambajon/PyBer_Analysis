# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
  The purpuse of this analysis is to provide a summary of ride-share data from rural, suburban, and urban city types. Charts and graphs will be used to showcase the results. The analysis and visualizations were created in Jupyter lab with using Python with matplotlib and pandas.

## Results
  After analyzing the ride-share data from rural, suburban and urbam city types, we can conclude the following:
which city types had the highest and lowest number of rides.
which city types had the highest and lowest number of drivers.
which city types had the highest and lowest total fares.
which city types had the highest and lowest average fare per ride.
which city types had the highest and lowest average fare per driver. 

  The highest number of rides were from urban city types with 1625 total rides, followed by suburban citiesm with 625 total rides, and them rural city types with 125 total rides. The total number of drivers and total fares follow the same trend of highest to lowest, urban, suburban and then rural.

  While that is the case for those 3 categories, we see the opposite for the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Rural city types have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver, $34.62 and $55.49 respectively. Suburban city types are in the middle for average fare per ride and average fare per driver, with $30.97 and $39.50 respectively. Urbam city types had the lowest average fare per ride and fare per driver with $24.53 and $16.57 respectivley.





This line chart illustrates the relationship between ride-share fare totals and different city types. Urban cities have the highest amount of fares, followed by suburban cities, and then rural cities. While there are some spikes in usage during certain times, like the end of February, the amount of fares stay consistent within their city types.
